Hi!

[View the current state of this project](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/icecream17/tic-tac-toe-grow/blob/main/game.html)

Note: this uses normalize.css, see that file's comment for details.


## How to play
Win by getting either 7-in-a-row, or a checkmark.  
The board grows 1-step orthogonally from each square that's been played.

A checkmark would be a right angle if the squares' height and width are the same,  
which they usually aren't.
A checkmark is connected diagonally,  
with two sides having 2 and 4 squares respectively,  
where all squares are played by the same player,  
and the two sides share a square.

Examples:

![Lots of moves have been played, O has won with a sideways checkmark.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58114641/99096744-448ab900-259c-11eb-89b2-2d57672b40f9.png)
![Easy 7 in a row win. All moves by X are in the 7 in a row.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58114641/99097026-a21f0580-259c-11eb-9955-e3f7d6663132.png)
