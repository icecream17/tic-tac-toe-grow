Hi!

This isn't done yet

## How to play
Win by getting either 7-in-a-row, or a checkmark.  
The board grows 1-step orthogonally from each square that's been played.

A checkmark would be a right angle if the squares' height and width are the same,  
which they usually aren't.
A checkmark is connected diagonally,  
with two sides having 2 and 4 squares respectively,  
where all squares are played by the same player,  
and the two sides share a square.

Example:
```
O wins!
 ___   
_XOX__
 __O_X_
  _XO_O_
   __OX_
     __
```
